- 3 cups sifted flour
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 cup butter
- 2 eggs
- 1 tbsp vanilla
- 2 tbsp lemon juice
- 6 peeled, cored, and sliced apples

1. Crush and combine flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder.
2. Cut in butter.
3. Beat in eggs, vanilla, and lemon juice.
4. Blend well. Divide dough in half. Roll out half of dough to fit a 13x9-inch baking pan. Tip: Try rolling dough on floured wax paper to make it easier to handle.
5. Arrange sliced apples on top of dough. Sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon to taste. Dot with butter.
6. Roll out remaining half of dough and place on top of apples. Seal edges.
7. Perforate top crust with a fork to allow steam to escape.
8. Bake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake for an additional 45 minutes. Serve warm or cold.
