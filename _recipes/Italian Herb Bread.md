# Italian Herb Bread

- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 clove garlic, pressed
- 1 tsp dried basil
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1/2 tsp dried rosemary
- 1/4 tsp dried thyme
- 1/4 cup water
- 1/4 cup milk
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 cups bread flour
- 1 1/2 tsp yeast

1. Heat oil in a small skillet. Add the garlic and herbs. Saute for 2 minutes, taking care not to let the garlic scorch or it will turn bitter. If necessary, remove the pan from the stove. The herbs will continue cooking in the oil's heat.
2. Put the herb oil and remaining ingredients in a bread pan in the order suggested by your bread machine instructions.
3. Set for white bread, medium crust. Press Start.
